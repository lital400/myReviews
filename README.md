Product Review Web Page Assignment

## Description

```
The goal of this assignment is to write a simple product review web page. 

Specifications:

1. The page will be for a product listing of your choice 
(include a product description, image and star rating based on the number of reviews submitted).
Note: there won’t be a way to store the reviews, so when the page first loads the product’s star rating should be set at 0 (no stars).

2. There should be a button for users to leave a rating (1-5 stars), an optional comment and their name. 
Provide basic error checking and input validation.

3. After the user submits their review, it should be appended to the bottom of the review section,
and should include their rating, comment, name and date of posting. 

4. The star rating average should then be re-calculated and displayed.

5. The code for this application should be written using ONLY HTML, CSS and TypeScript.
